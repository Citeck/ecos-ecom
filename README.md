# `ecos-ecom`

Welcome to the Citeck `ecos-ecom` repository! The microservice provides a solution for creating and managing email newsletters, chat bots within the platform.

## Get started

If you are new to Citeck platform and would like to run the software locally, we recommend you download the Dockerized version from [Demo repository](https://github.com/Citeck/ecos-community-demo).

## Useful Links

- [Documentation](https://citeck-ecos.readthedocs.io/ru/latest/index.html) provides more in-depth information.

## Dependencies

To run this application the following applications from Citeck deployment are needed:

* zookeeper
* rabbitmq
* ecos-model
* ecos-registry

## Development

To start your application in the dev profile, simply run:

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

If your IDE supports starting Spring Boot applications directly, then you can easily run the class 'ru.citeck.ecos.ecom.EComApplication' without additional setup.

### Building for production

To build the application for production, run:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean package jib:dockerBuild -Djib.docker.image.tag=custom 
```

To ensure everything worked, stop original ecos-ecom container and start ecos-ecom:custom instead of it.

### Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

```
./mvnw clean test
```

#### Code quality

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker compose -f docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean test sonar:sonar
```
